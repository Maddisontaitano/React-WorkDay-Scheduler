            This app was designed to help a user easily schedule
        events and meetings. The UI is clean and polished for
        the best user experience. Unfortunately I was unable to
        get the data to render back in the same hour tag without 
        it rendering in all the tags, so for now it will be renderin
        g to a list on the side of the page.
